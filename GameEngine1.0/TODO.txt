TO DO:

physics:
	add physics bounding
	add collision detections

update camera windows to be based on camera orientation
	up down
	left right
	6 possible orthographical angles to view world space

fix deltaTime step 
	only checks 1000ms from system time - sometimes dT is negative
		use second data to correct for that?

add coordinates to camera window
	axis and range - DONE

change render buffer to be inside border
	add buffer for axis numbers

add scroll functionality to AGUI
	partially complete


add user input
	move camera
	move entities

add tilemap
	add pathfinding
	add collision tilemap

on mouse state change of ui - update state change of related objects
	example: camera window - basenode_button
			 entity - basenode_button

component parent interace class?
	revisit need

custome window that creates entities in engine

GUI component ALIGNMENT functions
	when adding component without position
		set position automatically based on other components
GUI inherit background colors
GUI larger buttons with centered text

add call back to event system
	change event system to map of map 
		instead of map of vector
	
create onStart() function
	called when object is created
	maybe called by constructor 


Console tilemap rendering
	panning and zooming - done
		fix mouse positioning when zooming
	add specific tile types
	add heightmap generator
	add collision map
	add etc map

line of sight
	lighting
player -> controller mapping
raw input -> game commands mapping 
Collision checking
user controller
	actions
		move
		pathfinding
		behavior tree
Message System
	Queue
	Window

TileEvents
	MouseOver
Tile Info Window

render 2d side view data

Quadtree

smart pathing
	longer path but with goals
		move out of range of attacker
